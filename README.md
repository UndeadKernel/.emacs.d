========

My emacs configuration files. Take a look and see if there is anything interesting to you.


* Features
  - Modular distribution of configuration files.
  - Modules and plugins independant from package managers; that is, everything is self contained and does not require installing other packages.
  - Comments everywhere (ok, maybe not everywhere).
  - Useful bindings
